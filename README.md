RHEL Apache Web Server Deployment




The project titled RHEL Apache Web Server Deployment focuses on deploying an Apache web server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The primary objective is to create a fully functional web server  that  serves  static  web  content.  The  process  includes  the installation and configuration of Apache, followed by the creation of an index.html file, which serves as the default webpage.  After  configuring  the  server,  the  IP  address  of  the machine  is  retrieved  using  the  ip  addr  show  command.  By entering this IP into a browser, the server responds by displaying the contents of the index.html file, confirming successful deployment.

This project not only demonstrates core server setup skills but also highlights  important  concepts  such  as  IP  address  configuration, web  server  management,  and  basic  Linux  administration.  The deployment illustrates a practical use case  of  hosting  a  web page on a Linux server, offering valuable insights into the process of managing and securing web servers. This project serves as a foundation for more complex web hosting and server management tasks, emphasizing the reliability and flexibility of Apache on the RHEL platform.
